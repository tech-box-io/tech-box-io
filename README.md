Tech Box is a family-owned and operated business that seeks to engage people of all 
  ages in learning how to create, build, program, and even automate cool and interesting 
  devices. We know that young people are often not able to experience crafting and programming 
  their own pieces of technology until late in their school career. Since early exposure to 
  programming and electronics is highly correlated to positive outcomes, we believe that 
  gaining exposure to these types of technologies is critical. In order to bridge this gap, 
  Tech Box offers young people some much needed inspiration and encouragement with the aid of 
  pre-constructed kits with user-friendly guides and materials that they can even use when 
  designing their own electronic devices. Of course, we also believe that people can never be 
  too old to create, so Tech Box offers many designs with increased complexity for our more 
  experienced users. Needless to say, Tech Box will allow the whole family to participate in 
  the fun of creating and building electronics with the added satisfaction of being able to 
  use and even modify your new creations as you like!

Often, initial experiences with DIY electronics can be frustrating, as libraries may be 
  missing, software revisions may be inconsistent, or the instructions provided in an online 
  guide may no longer be accurate or functional. In many cases, the components online guides 
  list in their instructions may not even be available or complete. Tech Box seeks to fix 
  these frustrations, as all of our guides and libraries are written, controlled, and 
  supported by us. Our all-inclusive kits come with the hardware, software, and the 
  easy-to-follow instructions and video guides needed to turn each kit into the project of 
  your (or your children's) dreams with no-hassle or frustration!
